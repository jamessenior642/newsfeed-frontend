# News Summarizer Frontend

This is the frontend application for the News Summarizer project. It is built using React and TypeScript and is hosted on Netlify.

## Features
- **Responsive UI:** Optimized for all screen sizes.
- **News Feed:** Displays article summaries generated by the backend AI.
- **User Authentication:** Allows users to log in using Google OAuth.
- **Article Management:** Users can upload, view, and manage articles.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Navigate between news feed, profile, and article upload pages.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or above)
- A `.env` file with the following:
  ```
  REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
  ```

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-summarizer-frontend.git
   cd news-summarizer-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Build the app for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Use the build directory for deployment.
   - Configure the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in Netlify.

## Folder Structure
- `src/components`: Contains React components like Navbar, ArticleCard, etc.
- `src/services`: Axios-based services for API interaction.
- `src/pages`: Contains pages like Home, Profile, and ArticleUpload.
- `public`: Static assets like the favicon.

## How It Works
- Fetches data from the backend via Axios using the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable.
- Displays articles and summaries from the backend's `/api/articles` endpoint.
- Handles user authentication through Google OAuth.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the backend is running and accessible via the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`.
- Check browser console for any CORS-related errors.
